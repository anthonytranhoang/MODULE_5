This challenge was really a bit of a challenge for me as it took longer than others. 
I had to review classes again and learn about the basics of f strings and resetting indexes. 
Learning about the correlation coefficient was also very new to me. 
The box plot and outlier graph was also another chart that took me a bit of time.
